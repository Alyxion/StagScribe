An abstract geometric composition on a near-black background featuring overlapping semi-transparent shapes. A large purple circle, a rounded coral rectangle, a turquoise circle, and a rotated gold diamond layer over one another, creating rich color blends at their intersections. Crimson and dodgerblue crosshair lines bisect the canvas, and a small green accent ellipse anchors the lower-left corner.
