Seven vertical color bars arranged side by side on a dark background, simulating a rainbow gradient effect. The bars progress from deep violet on the left through indigo, blue, teal, and green, transitioning to gold and finishing with crimson on the right. Each bar is equally sized, creating a bold, stripe-based spectrum.
