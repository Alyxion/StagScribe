A restaurant floor plan on a 1000 by 750 pixel canvas showing a full dining establishment. The large dining area occupies the left side with six tables (a mix of round and rectangular), plus booth seating along the wall, while a bar with a long counter, stools, and drink display runs along the bottom. The kitchen fills the upper right corner with a prep counter, stove area, grill, walk-in cooler, and dish station. Two restrooms are in the lower right, and a host stand marks the entrance at the bottom left.
