A standard classroom floor plan on a 900 by 650 pixel canvas with a white background. A wide whiteboard spans the top-left front wall, with the teacher's desk and chair positioned to the right of it. Sixteen student desks are arranged in a 4-column by 4-row grid in the center of the room, evenly spaced with gaps between rows. A tall bookshelf lines the right wall, a supply cabinet and trash can sit in the back-left corner, and three windows run along the left wall, with the door at the bottom left.
