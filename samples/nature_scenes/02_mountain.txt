A mountain landscape under a clear cornflower blue sky with a golden sun. Two ranges of mountains are visible: a distant slate-gray range with white snow caps, and a closer green range in the foreground. A lush green meadow stretches across the lower portion, dotted with dark evergreen trees and a sandy path winding into the distance.
