A warm sunset scene viewed from a low horizon. The sky transitions from deep slate blue at the top through layers of dark orange and red, down to a golden glow near the horizon. A bright golden sun sits just above the dark silhouetted land, with faint reddish clouds scattered across the sky and a subtle reflection on the ground below.
