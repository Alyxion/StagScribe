A cheerful garden scene on a bright day with a light blue sky, fluffy white clouds, and a golden sun. A wooden fence with evenly spaced posts stretches across the middle, separating the sky from a lush green lawn below. Five colorful flowers in red, yellow, purple, pink, and orange bloom in a row across the grass, each with distinct petals and a contrasting center. A small blue butterfly floats above the garden, and a sandy path leads away into the foreground.
