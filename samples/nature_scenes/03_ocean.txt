A calm ocean scene under a bright sky with scattered white clouds and a pale yellow sun. The deep steel-blue water stretches across the lower half, layered with gentle rolling waves and thin lines of white foam. A small brown sailboat with white sails and a red pennant drifts near the center, while three distant birds arc across the sky above.
