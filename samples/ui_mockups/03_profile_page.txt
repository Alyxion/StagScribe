A user profile page built for a mobile viewport of 375x700 pixels. A blue header banner spans the top, with a circular avatar overlapping its lower edge displaying the user's initials "JD" on a light blue background. Below the avatar, the user's display name and handle are centered, followed by a white rounded stats bar showing counts for Posts, Followers, and Following. Two side-by-side action buttons provide "Follow" (solid blue) and "Message" (outlined blue) options. The lower section contains a white "About" card with a short bio and a separate row showing location and website link.
