A mobile settings panel on an iOS-style light gray background, sized at 375x680 pixels. The top navigation bar displays a blue "Back" link and a centered "Settings" title. The body is organized into three grouped sections -- Notifications, Appearance, and Privacy -- each introduced by an uppercase gray section header. Within each white rounded card, individual setting rows are separated by thin dividers, with toggle switches shown in green (on) or gray (off) states, and one drill-down row displaying a current value with a chevron. A version label is centered at the bottom of the panel.
