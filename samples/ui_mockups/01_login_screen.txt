A mobile login screen designed at 375x812 pixels, representing a standard iPhone viewport. The layout features a circular blue logo at the top, followed by the app name and a subtitle inviting the user to sign in. The central form area contains two rounded input fields for email and password, a "Forgot password?" link aligned to the right, and a prominent blue "Sign In" button. Below the form, a divider separates the primary login from a secondary "Continue with Google" option, and a sign-up prompt sits at the bottom of the screen.
