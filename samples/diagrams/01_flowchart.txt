A simple decision flowchart illustrating a basic data processing workflow. The flow begins at a Start node, moves through a Process Data step, and reaches an "Is Valid?" decision point. If the data is valid, the result is saved and the flow proceeds to End; if not, a Retry path branches off to the right. Connector lines link each stage, with the "No" path rendered as a dashed line to visually distinguish it from the main flow.
