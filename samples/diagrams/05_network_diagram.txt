A network topology diagram depicting a small office infrastructure centered around a core router. The Internet connects through a firewall to the router, which distributes traffic to an App Server (linked to a Database), two workstations, a WiFi laptop, and a network printer. Wired connections are shown as solid lines while wireless connections use dotted lines, and each device displays its role and IP address where applicable.
